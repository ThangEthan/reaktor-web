<h1>Magic the Gathering assignment – instructions</h1>

Here we go. Your task is to build an interactive, hyperlinked rulebook application for a card game, of which rules are described in rules.txt.

<b>When submitting your solution, your application must:</b>
<ul>
<li>Have a web frontend</li>
<li>Include a Table of Contents with hyperlinks to chapters containing game rules. For instance, “100. General” is a chapter</li>
<li>Display the selected chapter beside the Table of Contents, containing all rules in that chapter. For instance, “100.2a” is a rule</li>
<li>Include a search box for filtering the rules displayed on the page, so that you can, for instance, type “commander” and find all rules that mention the word “commander”</li>
</ul>
